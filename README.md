# Tzum
A survival-grade, hacker-inspired video chat system for low-bandwidth, air-gapped, or retro computing environments. Imagine you’re stuck with only a serial terminal, a Raspberry Pi, or even a satellite link — and still want to see someone’s face.
Tzum streams webcam data as real-time ASCII over the terminal using less than 10KB/s — turning any terminal into a crude yet effective video receiver.
